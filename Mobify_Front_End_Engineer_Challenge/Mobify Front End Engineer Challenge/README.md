Input: String s
Ouput: Array of elements (node)

Logic for descendant selector follows the description on mdn:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_selectors

Two values can be expected in the string 
Whitespaces before or after could be present

dummy.css and dummy.html were files used to test the code
with the string s replaced with the tested string
