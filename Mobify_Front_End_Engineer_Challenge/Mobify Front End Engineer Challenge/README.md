Input: String s
Ouput: Array of elements (node)

Logic for descendant selector follows the description on mdn:
https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/selector.html#descendant-selectors

Two or more values can be expected in the string
Whitespaces before or after could be present

dummy.css and dummy.html were files used to test the code
with the string s replaced with the tested string
