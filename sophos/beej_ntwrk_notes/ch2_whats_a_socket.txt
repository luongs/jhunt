* Socket: Way of speaking to other programs using standard Unix file descriptors
* In other words unix can read ntwk connection like a file
* Uses send() and recv() for better control

2.1 Two types of internet sockets

1) Datagram sockets => SOCK_DGRAM (connectionless socket)
  * May arrive, but out of order
  * UDP used
  * No need to keep an open connection
  * Good for speed and games

2) Stream Sockets => SOCK_STREAM
  * error free and arrive in order
  * used in HTTP protocol
  * TCP used to keep a high level of data transmission

Data Encapsulation
[Ethernet[IP[UDP[TFTP[DATA]]]]]

Separated in layers: 
*Application (ftp,telnet, etc)
*Transport(TCP, UDP)
*Internet (IP)
*Network Access (Ethernet, wi-fi)
