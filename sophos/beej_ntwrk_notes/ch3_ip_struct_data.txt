IP Addresses, structs and Data Munging

3.1 IP Addresses v4 and v6
* IPv6 created to accomodate way more IP addresses for future computers
* IPv4 => numbers separated by dots
* IPv6 => Hex numbers

3.1.1 Subnets
* Separation of networks and host portion of IP addresses
* eg: 192.0.2.12 => host 12 on network 192.0.2.0

3.1.2 Port numbers
* Like the local address for the connection
* Think of IP address as the street address for a hotel 
  and port number as room number
* ex: HTTP => port 80, SMTP => port 25, DOOM => port 666

3.2 Byte order
* Bytes are stored as BigEndian (big end first) or LittleEndian (little end first)
* Different computers read bytes as BigEndian or LittleEndian
* Fortunately passing packets through a function will convert 
*htons(), htonl() / host to network short/long
* So you want to convert #s to netwk before they leave and
  convert them back when they return

3.3 structs
* socket descriptor => int type
* struct addrinfo => one of the first things called for a connection

3.4.1 Private Networks
* Firewalls translate "internal" IP addresses to "external" addresses using 
 Network Address Translation (NAT)
* Helps provide more IP addresses to a home network of computers
* Then translates those addresses to the outside
